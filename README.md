This project uses the **ATtiny2313 microcontroller**, combining **Fast PWM** and **external interrupts** to control a 4-wire fan. The idea is simple but effective:

## User Controls

- **Press the left button** to increase fan speed  
- **Press the right button** to decrease fan speed  
- **Max speed:** Right-side LED lights up  
- **Min speed:** Left-side LED turns on  

## Technical

- **Fast PWM on Timer0** generates the fan control signal  
- **INT0 and INT1** handle button inputs via external interrupts  
- **Debouncing** is done using **Timer1** directly inside the **Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)**  
- **Speed changes in steps**, with duty cycle limits checked to avoid overflow or underflow  
- **LED indicators** on **PB6** (min) and **PB7** (max) provide visual feedback

This approach provides clean, responsive fan speed control using just a few lines of code and **no delay functions**. All logic is handled through **interrupts**, making it efficient and **power-friendly** â€” ideal for embedded systems with limited resources!
